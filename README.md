# Gravity - The Social Pile

> "A social platform where statuses don’t scroll — they fall into a shared gravity pile."

Gravity is a playful experimental social interface where posts obey the laws of physics. Instead of a traditional infinite scroll feed, status updates spawn as physical objects that fall, collide, and stack on top of one another.

## 🌟 Core Concept

The platform transforms digital content into "tangible" objects.
*   **Physics-Based Feed:** Posts are distinct entities (pills/bubbles) that react to gravity and collision.
*   **Playful Interaction:** Users can drag, throw, and disrupt the pile of posts.
*   **Mood-Centric:** Every post starts with a "Vibe" check, coloring the post based on the sentiment (Happy, Sad, Exciting, etc.).

## 🎨 Visual Identity: Glassmorphism

The application features a premium **Glassmorphism** design language:
*   **Frosted Glass:** Modals and buttons use semi-transparent backgrounds with `backdrop-blur` to interact with the colorful elements behind them.
*   **Soft Gradients:** Subtle white-to-transparent gradients create depth and volume.
*   **Vibrant Moods:** The interface glows with the specific color of the content (e.g., Amber for Happy, Pink for Loving), using colored drop shadows and accents.
*   **Fluid Motion:** All interactions feature smooth spring-like animations.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. The Physics Pile
*   Powered by **Matter.js**.
*   Renders dynamic bodies based on text length (Circles, Pills, Blobs).
*   Real-time collision detection and stacking.
*   Drag-and-drop interaction for desktop and touch devices.

### 2. Mood-First Creation Flow
*   **Step 1:** Select a mood from a visual grid (Happy, Excited, Loving, Chill, Sad, Angry).
*   **Step 2:** Type your thought (140 char limit).
*   **Result:** The post drops physically into the world, styled with a glass-like finish and mood-specific color.

### 3. Interactive Details
*   Clicking a bubble opens a focused **Glass Detail Modal**.
*   **Upvote/Pass:** Binary voting system with bouncy micro-interactions.
*   **Save/Bookmark:** Save posts to your personal library.
*   **Report:** Moderation flagging system.

### 4. Utilities
*   **Search:** Filter the physics pile in real-time by text content.
*   **User Profile:** Customize handle, bio, and location (stored in local state).
*   **Settings:** Toggle sound, haptics, and dark mode preferences.
*   **Localization:** Toggle between English and Khmer (Demo UI).

### 5. Smart Content (Hybrid)
*   **Static Fallback:** Includes 100+ pre-written witty/humorous posts for instant demo load.
*   **AI Integrated:** Architecture includes `@google/genai` for dynamic sentiment analysis.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React 19 (TypeScript)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (extensive use of `backdrop-blur`, `bg-opacity`, and `gradients`)
*   **Physics Engine:** Matter.js
*   **Icons:** Lucide React
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (via `@google/genai`)
*   **Font:** 'Outfit' (Google Fonts)

## 📂 Project Structure

*   **`App.tsx`**: Main entry point, handles global state, search logic, and modal orchestration.
*   **`components/PhysicsWorld.tsx`**: The core canvas component. Bridges React state with the imperative Matter.js physics engine. Syncs DOM elements to physics bodies for the "Glass Pill" effect.
*   **`components/PostDetailModal.tsx`**: The primary view for consuming content, featuring mood-colored glowing shadows.
*   **`components/CreatePostModal.tsx`**: The 2-step creation wizard.
*   **`services/geminiService.ts`**: Handles AI requests and provides the static data fallback.
*   **`constants.ts`**: Configuration for physics attributes and Sentiment-to-Color mappings.

## 🌈 Sentiment Palette

*   **Happy:** Amber 300 (`#FCD34D`)
*   **Exciting:** Lime 300 (`#bef264`)
*   **Neutral:** Blue 400 (`#60A5FA`)
*   **Sad:** Gray 400 (`#9CA3AF`)
*   **Angry:** Red 500 (`#EF4444`)
*   **Loving:** Pink 400 (`#F472B6`)
