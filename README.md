# Gravity - The Social Pile

> "A social platform where statuses don’t scroll — they fall into a shared gravity pile."

Gravity is a playful experimental social interface where posts obey the laws of physics. Instead of a traditional infinite scroll feed, status updates spawn as physical objects that fall, collide, and stack on top of one another.

## 🌟 Core Concept

The platform transforms digital content into "tangible" objects.
*   **Physics-Based Feed:** Posts are distinct entities (pills/bubbles) that react to gravity and collision.
*   **Playful Interaction:** Users can drag, throw, and disrupt the pile of posts.
*   **Mood-Centric:** Every post starts with a "Vibe" check, coloring the post based on the sentiment (Happy, Sad, Exciting, etc.).

## 🚀 Features

### 1. The Physics Pile
*   Powered by **Matter.js**.
*   100+ posts render simultaneously with collision detection.
*   Posts "rain" down upon initialization or refresh.
*   Drag and throw interaction enabled for desktop and touch.

### 2. Mood-First Creation Flow
*   **Step 1:** Select a mood from a visual grid (Happy, Excited, Loving, Chill, Sad, Angry).
*   **Step 2:** Type your thought (140 char limit).
*   **Result:** The post drops physically into the world with a color matching its mood.

### 3. Interactive Details
*   Clicking a bubble opens a focused Detail Modal.
*   **Upvote/Pass:** Binary voting system.
*   **Report:** Moderation flagging.
*   **Share:** Placeholder for social sharing.

### 4. Smart Content (Hybrid)
*   **Static Fallback:** Includes 100+ pre-written witty/humorous posts for instant demo load.
*   **AI Integrated:** Architecture includes `@google/genai` for dynamic sentiment analysis (currently bypassed for speed in the demo mode).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React 19 (TypeScript)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Physics Engine:** Matter.js
*   **Icons:** Lucide React
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (via `@google/genai`)
*   **Font:** Google Sans & Outfit

## 📂 Project Structure

*   **`App.tsx`**: Main entry point, handles global state (posts list) and UI orchestration.
*   **`components/PhysicsWorld.tsx`**: The core canvas component. Bridges React state with the imperative Matter.js physics engine. Handles the synchronization of DOM elements to physics bodies.
*   **`components/CreatePostModal.tsx`**: The 2-step wizard for dropping new thoughts.
*   **`components/PostDetailModal.tsx`**: The view for interacting with a specific post.
*   **`services/geminiService.ts`**: Handles AI requests and provides the static data fallback for the initial "100 post" load.
*   **`constants.ts`**: Configuration for physics attributes (friction, restitution) and Sentiment-to-Color mappings.

## 🎨 Design System

*   **Palette:**
    *   Happy: Amber 300
    *   Exciting: Red 400
    *   Neutral: Blue 400
    *   Sad: Gray 400
    *   Angry: Red 500
    *   Loving: Pink 400
*   **Typography:** 'Outfit' and 'Google Sans' for a clean, modern, and friendly aesthetic.
*   **Shapes:** Heavily rounded corners (pills/circles) to emphasize softness and playfulness.
